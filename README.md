## 1. Set up on Windows with XAMPP

### 1.1 Install the tools
1. Install **Node.js 20 LTS or newer** from <https://nodejs.org> (tested with Node 22). Check it in a new terminal with `node -v`.
2. Install **XAMPP** (includes MySQL/MariaDB and phpMyAdmin).

### 1.2 Install the project dependencies
In a terminal at the project folder (`C:\xampp\htdocs\furniture-boxel`):

```bash
npm install --prefix server
npm install --prefix client
```

(or `npm run install:all`)

### 1.3 Start MySQL
Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**. Start **Apache** (only needed for phpMyAdmin) and **MySQL**.

### 1.4 Create the database
1. Open <http://localhost/phpmyadmin>.
2. Click **New**, enter the name `boxel_store`, choose collation **utf8mb4_unicode_ci**, then click **Create**.

### 1.5 Import the schema, then the seed
1. Select the `boxel_store` database, open **Import**, choose `database/schema.sql` and click **Import**.
2. Repeat with `database/seed.sql`.

Using the command line instead:

```bash
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root boxel_store < database\schema.sql
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root boxel_store < database\seed.sql
```

> Import `seed.sql` **once**. It contains no customers, orders, reviews or admin accounts.

### 1.6 Configure `server/.env`
```bash
copy server\.env.example server\.env
```
Then edit `server/.env`:
- **`SESSION_SECRET`**: required. Paste the output of `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`.
- **`DB_*`**: the defaults match a fresh XAMPP install (user `root`, empty password).
- **`CLIENT_URL`**: the address customers use (development: `http://localhost:5173`).

### 1.7 Configure SMTP (email)
Fill these in `server/.env`, then restart the server:

| Variable | Example (Gmail with an App Password) |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` (or `465` with `SMTP_SECURE=true`) |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | `false` for 587, `true` for 465 |
| `SMTP_USER` | your mailbox login |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | an app password, not your normal password |
| `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` | the address emails come from |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | the inbox that receives new-order and enquiry alerts |

If SMTP is empty, the store still works: emails are recorded in the email log as **skipped** and can be retried later.

### 1.8 Create the first administrator
```bash
npm run create-admin --prefix server
```
The script asks for a name, email and password. The password input is hidden; it needs at least 10 characters with letters and numbers. The password is stored as a bcrypt hash. The script **refuses to change an existing account** unless you type `yes`. There is no public admin sign-up route; more admins are added from **Admin → Admin users**.

### 1.9 Start the API and the website
Start **MySQL** in the XAMPP Control Panel. Then, in the project folder, start both servers with one command:
```bash
npm install      # first time only: installs the tool that runs both servers
npm run dev      # API → http://localhost:5000  +  Website → http://localhost:5173
```
Logs from the two servers are labelled `[API]` and `[WEB]`. Press **Ctrl + C** once to stop both.
If MySQL isn't running yet, the API waits and connects as soon as you start it.
(To run them separately: `npm run dev --prefix server` and `npm run dev --prefix client`.)
Vite forwards `/api`, `/uploads`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` to the API, so the browser only talks to `localhost:5173`.

| Service | Address |
|---|---|
| Website | http://localhost:5173 |
| Admin | http://localhost:5173/admin |
| API | http://localhost:5000 (health check: `/api/health`) |
| MySQL | localhost:3306 |

## 2. Before you take real orders: business decisions to make in the admin

The seed data deliberately invents nothing. Until you fill these in, the site shows honest placeholders:

| What | Where | Until it is set |
|---|---|---|
| **Parcel Drop Box price** | Admin → Products → boxel Parcel Drop Box → Pricing | Shows "Price coming soon"; add-to-cart and checkout refuse it (also enforced by the server) |
| **Payment method** | Admin → Store settings → Payments | Checkout is closed. Enable **cash on delivery** and/or **pay on confirmation** only if the business offers them. Online card/UPI stays off until a payment provider is integrated. |
| Business email, city, state, address, map | Admin → Business contact | Hidden from the site |
| Store or service area | Admin → Business contact → Location | Shows "Delivering across India" |
| Social profiles | Admin → Social links | The "Follow boxel" section and footer icons stay hidden |
| Warranty duration and terms | Admin → Shipping & policies | The policy says the terms will be published |
| Returns and cancellation terms | Admin → Shipping & policies | The policy asks customers to contact you |
| Privacy policy and terms text | Admin → Store settings → Legal pages | Starter text describing what the site actually does. **Have it reviewed.** |
| Tax (GST) | Admin → Store settings → Tax | No tax lines are shown |
| Product dimensions and other specifications | Admin → Products → Specifications | Only verified attributes are listed |

---

## 3. Test checklist (steps 12–19 of the setup)

1. **Catalogue**: open `/products`. Search, filter by category or availability, and sort. Coming-soon categories show a "coming soon" message and can never be added to the cart.
2. **Price and payment**: in the admin, set a price for the Parcel Drop Box and enable a payment method.
3. **Cart, quantity and colour**: on the product page, pick a colour (variants come from the admin), change the quantity, then add to cart. The cart count updates and the drawer opens. Totals in the cart are **recalculated by the server** from live prices.
4. **Place a test order**: go to checkout. Submit an empty form to see the validation, then fill in an Indian mobile number (`98450 12345`, `+91 98450 12345` and `09845012345` are all accepted) and a PIN code (`560 038` or `560038`). Place the order.
5. **Check that it saved in MySQL**: in phpMyAdmin, look in `orders`, `order_items` (snapshot of name, colour and price), `payments` (status `pending`) and `order_status_history`.
6. **Emails**: see Admin → Email → Email log. With SMTP configured, the customer confirmation and the admin alert show **sent**. Failed emails have a **Retry** button there and on the order page.
7. **Admin**: sign in at `/admin/login`. The dashboard shows live figures. Open the order and move it through Confirmed → In production → Shipped → Delivered. Add tracking and an internal note, record the payment, and print the summary.
8. **Manage content**: add, edit, archive or delete products and categories. Change the homepage hero under **Homepage & banners**. Moderate reviews, answer enquiries, edit FAQs. Then refresh the public site to see the changes.

### Automated API tests
```bash
npm test --prefix server
```
This recreates a **separate database, `boxel_store_test`**, from the SQL files and runs 35 tests. They cover:
- Authentication: sign-up, sign-in and sign-out, generic error messages
- CSRF protection and the HTTP-only cookie
- Product listing and product detail
- Admin access control and roles
- Product administration: validation, duplicate slugs, the activity log
- Overselling prevention
- Archive-not-delete for products that have orders
- Category deletion protection
- Checkout validation
- Server-side totals
- Transactional order creation with snapshots
- Idempotent retries
- Order ownership
- The status transition policy
- Gross order value vs collected revenue
- Enquiry sanitisation and review moderation

Lint and build the client:
```bash
npm run lint --prefix client
npm run build --prefix client
```

## 4. How things work

### Orders
- **Checkout** sends only variant IDs and quantities. The server validates every field, then opens a **MySQL transaction**. Inside it, the server:
  1. locks the variant rows (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`)
  2. re-checks product, category and variant status, the price and the stock
  3. recalculates subtotal, shipping and tax
  4. decrements tracked stock atomically (`… WHERE stock_quantity >= ?`)
  5. creates the order, item snapshots, a pending payment and the first status-history row
  6. commits
- **Idempotency:** every checkout visit sends a UUID (`orders.idempotency_key` is unique). Retries and double clicks return the same order instead of creating a second one. If the total changed since the customer reviewed it, the order is refused and the customer is asked to review again.
- **Emails** are sent after the commit. A mail failure never fails or loses an order: it is logged in `email_notification_logs` and can be retried.
- **Order numbers** look like `BX-261015-7KQ4M` (date plus a random code, enforced unique).
- **Made to order vs stock:** products have **Track stock** off by default (made to order, no ceiling). Turn it on to enforce per-variant stock. Cancelling an order restores tracked stock.

### Order status policy
`Received (pending) → Confirmed → In production → Shipped → Delivered`. An order can be **cancelled** until it ships. Orders never move backwards, and nothing is marked delivered automatically. Every change records the admin and the time in `order_status_history` and the activity log.

**Payment** status is separate. An order is marked **paid** only when staff record that the money was received (with an optional reference). That is also logged. **Gross order value** on the dashboard counts every order that isn't cancelled. **Collected revenue** counts only recorded payments.

### Roles
| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Support | Dashboard, orders (status, notes, tracking), customers, enquiries, reviews |
| Admin | Everything above, plus products, categories, content, settings, payments and the activity log |
| Super admin | Everything, plus admin users and email notification settings |

Every admin request is checked on the server. Hiding buttons in the interface is never relied on as protection.

### Security summary
- Parameterised SQL everywhere.
- Every input is validated on the server with zod; HTML is stripped from free text.
- React escapes all output, and admin-entered text is rendered as text, never as HTML.
- bcrypt password hashes (cost 12).
- Accounts lock for 15 minutes after 5 failed sign-ins; sign-in errors are generic.
- Rate limits on sign-in, sign-up, password reset, contact, reviews, newsletter and checkout.
- Sessions are stored in MySQL. The cookie is HTTP-only and SameSite=Lax, and becomes `Secure` automatically when `NODE_ENV=production` and `CLIENT_URL` is `https://`. The session ID rotates on sign-in.
- CSRF: a synchronizer token kept in the session must be sent as `X-CSRF-Token` on every state-changing request.
- Helmet security headers with a Content-Security-Policy; CORS is restricted to `CLIENT_URL`.
- Uploads: JPEG, PNG or WebP only, up to 5 MB. Every image is decoded and re-encoded to WebP with sharp, which strips metadata and rejects non-images.
- Errors never include stack traces in production.
- Secrets live only in `server/.env`, which git ignores.

### SEO
- Every page sets a title, description, canonical URL and Open Graph tags (React 19 metadata).
- **In production, Express also injects these tags into the HTML on the server** (`server/services/seoService.js`), so crawlers and link previews don't need JavaScript.
- Product JSON-LD includes **offers only when there is a real price**, and **ratings only from approved reviews**. Organisation and breadcrumb data are included.
- `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are generated from the database.
- Client-side rendering still has limits for search engines; the server-injected tags reduce, but don't remove, that dependency.

### Design notes
- Palette: Canvas `#FFFFFF`, Stone `#F7F7F5`, warm **Sand `#F1EDE6`** for alternating sections, **Charcoal `#121211`** for the cinematic product showcase, contact section and footer, Ink `#171717`, Graphite `#707070`, Hairline `#E8E8E5`, and **Signal orange `#F17E00`, sampled from the supplied logo**. On white, orange is used only for marks, icons and focus rings; on charcoal it becomes the button colour (ink text on orange, 6.9:1 contrast). A soft orange glow is the only gradient.
- Premium sections: the hero has a frosted spec card; the product showcase has numbered markers on the open-box photo (verified attributes only); "From order to your door" is a timeline whose orange line draws as you scroll; the dark footer uses `boxel-logo-white.png` (the same logo with a white wordmark).
- Type: **Albert Sans** (self-hosted). Display sizes use weight 300 to echo the logo's thin strokes.
- The motif is the logo's **skewed tile**. The homepage hero assembles three tiles over a grey "studio" panel that matches the product photography's own backdrop.
- Animation: Framer Motion with `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` plus a CSS reduced-motion fallback. Scroll reveals run once (`viewport: { once: true }`); scroll-linked movement is bounded and uses transforms only.
- Images: the supplied `boxel-logo.jpeg` is kept unchanged. `boxel-logo-trimmed.png` is the same logo with its whitespace padding removed and a transparent background, at the same proportions, used in the interface. `server/assets/boxel-logo-email.png` is used in emails.

## 5. Production build
```bash
npm run build --prefix client      # creates client/dist
set NODE_ENV=production            # PowerShell: $env:NODE_ENV="production"
npm start --prefix server
```
When `client/dist` exists, Express serves the website and a **fallback for every route**, so `/products/parcel-drop-box`, `/account/orders` and other deep links work on refresh. It injects SEO tags per page and caches hashed assets for a year.

On a real server:
- Put it behind HTTPS (nginx or a hosting platform) with `CLIENT_URL=https://your-domain`.
- Leave `TRUST_PROXY=1` (the default in production).
- Use a dedicated MySQL user instead of `root`.

If you host the site under Apache instead, rewrite unknown paths to `index.html` and proxy `/api`, `/uploads`, `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` to Node.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `[db] Cannot connect to MySQL` | Start MySQL in XAMPP. Check `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`. Make sure `boxel_store` exists and `schema.sql` has been imported. |
| `ER_NO_SUCH_TABLE` | Import `database/schema.sql` into the database named in `DB_NAME`. |
| MySQL won't start in XAMPP (port 3306 busy) | Another MySQL service is running. Stop it in **services.msc**, or change the port in XAMPP and in `DB_PORT`. |
| `Port 5000 is already in use` | Stop the other process (`netstat -ano \| findstr :5000`, then `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`) or change `PORT` (and `VITE_API_PROXY` for Vite). |
| Website loads but the API fails, or CORS errors | Open the site through Vite (`localhost:5173`), not the API port. If you use another address, add it to `CLIENT_URL` / `CORS_ORIGINS`. |
| "Your session expired. Refresh the page" | The CSRF token changed (for example after restarting with a new secret). Refresh the page. |
| Sign-in doesn't stick in production | Over HTTPS, cookies are `Secure`. Make sure the proxy forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `TRUST_PROXY=1`. |
| Emails are "skipped" | SMTP isn't configured. Fill in the `SMTP_*` settings and restart. |
| Emails are "failed" | Read the error in Admin → Email. Common causes: wrong port/secure combination (587 → `false`, 465 → `true`), Gmail without an app password, or the from address not allowed by your provider. Use **Send test email**, then **Retry**. |
| Uploads fail | Images only (JPEG, PNG or WebP), up to 5 MB. `server/uploads` must be writable. |
| Checkout says no payment method | Enable one in Admin → Store settings → Payments. |
| "Price coming soon" everywhere | Set the product price in Admin → Products. |

## 6a. Keeping XAMPP MySQL healthy

MySQL tables get corrupted when MySQL is **killed** instead of shut down cleanly: closing XAMPP, shutting down the PC with MySQL running, or a power cut. Tools in `C:\xampp\mysql-tools\`:

| Tool | When to use it |
|---|---|
| `mysql-stop-safely.bat` | Before closing XAMPP or shutting down the PC. Flushes everything to disk. |
| `mysql-health-check.bat` | If XAMPP shows any MySQL error, or once a month. Checks every table and repairs damaged ones automatically. |
| `mysql-backup.bat` | Backs up every database to `C:\xampp\mysql-backups` (kept for 14 days). Also runs daily at 18:00 (Task Scheduler: "XAMPP MySQL daily backup"). |
| `install-mysql-service-RUN-AS-ADMIN.bat` | Best protection: runs MySQL as a Windows service, so Windows always stops it cleanly. |

`C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini` also sets:
- automatic crash recovery (`aria_recover_options`, `myisam_recover_options`)
- a full flush on shutdown (`innodb_fast_shutdown=0`)
- `max_allowed_packet=64M`, which prevents "MySQL server has gone away" on large imports

The boxel API waits and retries if MySQL isn't running yet, instead of exiting.

To restore a backup: phpMyAdmin → select the database → **Import** → choose the `.sql` file from `C:\xampp\mysql-backups\<date>\`.

## 7. API overview
Public: `GET /api/site`, `/api/categories`, `/api/products`, `/api/products/:slug`, `/api/products/:slug/reviews`, `/api/faqs` · `POST /api/cart/quote` · `POST /api/orders` · `GET /api/orders/confirmation/:orderNumber` · `POST /api/enquiries`, `/api/newsletter` · `/api/auth/*` · `/api/account/*`.

Admin (session plus role checked on every request): `/api/admin/{dashboard, notifications, search, products, categories, orders, customers, reviews, enquiries, newsletter, faqs, banners, social-links, settings/:group, email/*, users, activity-logs, uploads}`.
