-- boxel store — initial content
-- Import AFTER schema.sql. Contains no customers, orders, reviews or
-- admin accounts. Create the first admin with:  npm run create-admin
--
-- IMPORTANT: the Parcel Drop Box is seeded with price 0.00, which the
-- store treats as "price not set" — it is visible but cannot be bought
-- until an admin enters the real price in Admin → Products.
